{"asin": "B004N62M26", "description": "Brides of the Kindred &#xA0;Races and their characteristics,Rules andCast of characters&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; In the Brides of the Kindred series, I am introducing a race of genetic traders who have traveled the universe for centuries looking for viable matches to expand their gene pool.&#xA0;The three genetic trades the Kindred have already made have resulted in three very specific types of men. But though they take on some of the physical characteristics of the race they are trading with, the Kindred gene always ensures three things: physical prowess, extremely large and muscular body structure, and undying loyalty to the female of their choice.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Beast Kindredcome from Rageron--a jungle planet full of beautiful but deadly flora and fauna. They have dark hair, golden eyes, and hot tempers but their most defining characteristic is the mating fist. The mating fist is an area at the base of the Beast Kindred's shaft which engages fully only during bonding sex with his chosen mate. This ensures sex that is both tantric and multiorgasmic for both partners.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Blood Kindredare blond with pale blue eyes and come from Tranq Prime where ice, snow, and arctic-like temperatures are the norm. They have a set of double fangs located where a human's canine teeth would be. These fangs do not develop fully or become sharp enough to pierce flesh until a Blood Kindred is with a woman he wishes to mate and bond with.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Twin Kindredcome from Twin Moons--a world of vast, stormy oceans dotted with craggy but beautiful islands. True to their namesake, Twin Kindred always come in pairs. The brothers are not identical, however. There is always a light twin and a dark twin. These labels refer not just to skin, hair, and eye coloring but to the twin's moods and perceptions of the world. The dark twin in the pair is usually more moody and withdrawn while the light twin takes a substantially brighter view of life.&#xA0;&#xA0;In all their years of travel the Kindred have come across only three worlds with species close enough to their own to initiate a trade.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Earth is the fourth.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; After saving the Earth from the ravaging attack of the Scourge (actually a genetic trade gone wrong, a fact which most of the Kindred are unaware of) the Kindred warriors demand compensation from the governments of Earth--the right to call brides from among our world's population. Having no choice (the Scourge are still out there) Earth agrees. A type of draft is set up and every unmarried woman between the ages of nineteen and thirty-five is required to register. The chances of winning this &quot;bed-an-alien&quot; contest are about the same as winning the lottery--very rare--but it does happen on a regular basis. Before calling his bride, a Kindred warrior will become aligned with her and they will dream-share--or see each other's memories and daily activities in dreams regularly.Women who are drafted are required to go up to the Kindred Mothership and spend a thirty day &quot;claiming period&quot; with the warrior who has chosen them. If, at the end of that time, they have managed to resist the charms of their Kindred mate, they are allowed to go back down to Earth and resume their normal life. However, if they succumb to their Kindred male's seduction, they are mated for life and must move to the Kindred ship to live, leaving everything else behind and seeing their family and friends on Earth only infrequently. And the Kindred have a secret weapon--devotion to their female's pleasure and attention to detail during incredibly hot sex.&#xA0;The Rules of the Claiming PeriodThe Claiming Period lasts for four weeks:The Holding Week:the Kindred warrior may hold his bride onlyThe Bathing Week:the warrior and his bride bathe together and he is allowed to&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; massage her with scented oils.The Tasting Week:the warrior is allowed to perform oral sex on his bride.The Bonding Week:sex is allowed but it is completely up to the bride whether she will take things a step further and allow bonding sex which is a special and specific process to the three different types of Kindred males. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The only way out before the claiming period is up is a breach of contract. This can happen if the Kindred warrior does not strictly follow the rules and tries to skip forward in the order of allowed events or by breaking one of the rules laid down by the Kindred High Council. These rules--mostly to do with restrictions on communication with Earth--are for the safety of everyone aboard the Mothership and are nonnegotiable. &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;BairdHero of Book 1ClaimedBaird is a Beast Kindred, a native of Rageron. His father is one of the rare purebred Kindred whose bloodline has never mingled in a trade before so he has all the characteristics of his home planet. At six foot seven with black hair and golden eyes Baird is nobody to mess with and he has just been through a horrific ordeal. Captured and held by the Scourge he has been tortured by the evil AllFather who had a special affinity for the taste of his psychic pain. Throughout this ordeal, only one thing has kept Baird sane--the alignment of his mind with that of his bride's. When he escapes the Scourge Fathership his goal is to claim her without delay. &#xA0;&#xA0;Olivia Waterhouse (Liv)Heroine of Book 1Claimed&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Olivia is in her mid twenties and has just graduated from nursing school. She lives in Tampa, Florida with her best friend and twin sister, Sophia and their good friend Kat.&#xA0;Liv is stubborn, intelligent, and not afraid to stand up for herself. &#xA0;With her nursing degree in hand and the rest of her life ahead of her she would be feeling great about life if she hadn't started having such dark, disturbing dreams which all center on a man with black hair and golden eyes. She has no idea what the dreams mean but when two hulking envoys from the Human/Kindred Relations bureau show up on her front step to collect her, she begins to get the picture.Not being the type to go quietly, Liv fights the process of her claiming every step of the way. Though she is required by law to go aboard the Kindred Mothership and spend the thirty day claiming period with Baird, she makes no secret of the fact that she fully intends to wind up back on Earth living her normal life at the end of that time. Of course, Baird is just as determined to keep her as his wife.&#xA0;SylvanHero of Book 2Hunted&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Sylvan is a Blood Kindred, a native of Tranq Prime and Baird's half brother. He is built along the same massive lines as all Kindred warriors and has the blond hair and ice blue eyes of his people. He also has the cold, logical demeanor all Tranqs possess. But despite his icy exterior, Sylvan has been hurt in the past. After suffering a devastating rejection on Tranq Prime, he has vowed never to take a bride and no woman can move him. Until he meets Olivia's twin sister, Sophia, that is. Then, much to his chagrin, his mating instincts roar to life and he has to remind himself constantly that she is off limits.&#xA0;Sophia (Sophie)Heroine of Book 2Hunted&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Despite their shared looks, Sophie is Liv's polar opposite. She's shy and gentle but not weak though it takes her a little time to learn to stand up for herself. She's a first grade teacher and an artist who loves to paint. She's also fiercely loyal to her twin and horrified when Liv is taken away to the Kindred Mothership. Her antipathy toward Baird, who she sees as her sister's kidnapper, extends to Sylvan as well so their relationship is stormy right from the start.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Though she dislikes Sylvan, Sophie can't help the way her body responds to him. She tries to avoid him but inHunted&#xA0;their ship is forced down in the middle of the Blue Ridge Mountains while trying to return from the Kindred Mothership to Earth. Wounded and frightened, she has no one else to turn to when it becomes clear the Scourge are hunting her for their own nefarious purposes.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;", "price": 3.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JzZ8ibarL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Erotica"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Erotica", "Paranormal"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Erotica", "Romantic Erotica"]]}

Placing his hand on the small of her back, he urged her toward the staircase.Elizabeth looked up at him, her protest poised on the tip of her tongue when she saw the lust in his eyes. But that wasn't what gave her pause; it was the glimmer of satisfaction in making her wary and nervous.By God, heknewshe wasn't about to just let him&#xa0;have his way with her. Certainly not before they married. So what was his game?&quot;And is that where you hope to seduce me?&quot; Her parents would be appalled had they heard her. She was astonished anything in that vein was able to pass her lips.Lord Creswell didn't respond until they reached the first door on the third floor.&#xa0;No doubt a bed was on the other side of that door.He turned to her. &quot;If I may be frank, Miss Smith...Elizabeth.&quot; He spoke her name, soft and low, and somehow her name on his lips sounded more intimate than a kiss. &quot;I am a man who likes to leave nothing to chance. If I am to court and marry you in such unfashionable haste, I would like some assurance that you and I suit when it comes to the intimacies of the marriage bed.&quot;At his words, lust in its most pure form accosted her. Parts of her went soft while other parts became rigid, pinpoints of pleasure to come.No. No. No. There would be no pleasure of any sort. Not for her and definitely none for the viscount.&quot;So you would like us to have marital relations outside the sanctity of marriage?&quot; she asked in a voice she barely recognized.&#xa0;&quot;You've been so skittish of late. If I hadn't already kissed you, I think you didn't like to be touched. When I marry, it'll be for life and I have no desire to saddle myself with a wife who cannot perform satisfactory in that area.&quot; Lord Creswell turned, his back to her as he faced the chamber door. But on his face, she glimpsed the barest hint of smile.So that was how he thought to get around marrying her. He thought she'd cry off, refusing to enter his philistine game of sampling the goods.For several long seconds, Elizabeth said nothing, allowing him to believe she was grappling in indecision. His hand released its grasp on the handle of the door and he straightened as if ready to claim victory.&quot;Very well, if that's what it will take to ease your mind--ease both our minds--let us proceed. But I must have your assurance that once we've established that we suit, um, in that way, we will immediately announce our betrothal and set a wedding date.&quot;Elizabeth took great satisfaction in watching Lord Creswell's entire form stiffen and his hand still in mid-air. Slowly, he angled his head over his shoulder to regard her, incredulity flashing briefly in the&#xa0; blue-green depths of his eyes. &quot;You are in agreement?&quot;Feigning the stalwartness of that of a virgin about to be sacrificed for the good of God and country, Elizabeth gave a tremulous but firm nod.&quot;And if we do not suit, what then?&quot;Did his voice sound a mite strained?&quot;I have a feeling we shall suit very well.&quot; She gave him a slow smile. &quot;Shall we proceed, my lord?&quot;", "price": 14.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hb44nB0cL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction"], ["Books", "Romance", "Anthologies"], ["Books", "Romance", "Historical", "Victorian"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Collections & Anthologies"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Historical Romance", "Victorian"]]}

{"asin": "B005GMUU8O", "description": "*PLEASE READ*&#xa0;This book in the Parched novel series is shorter than average to deal with the limitations of writing in the first person point of view (or POV). Parched Book One, and most of the series is told in Clarity's POV but as the saga continues to unfold other sisters will be introduced, and their lives are interesting as well!After completing Book 1, I knew it was time to introduce Zillael, who in my head had this entire backstory. She is falling for two supernatural creatures and how their association came to be is the focus of The Seventh Sister (Parched, book 2). However, and this is very important, the end of this book picks up right where it leaves off in Quenched (Parched, book 3) at the point where I'm ready to introduce Zillael into the main plot.Also, this is NOT a YA novel series.This particular story is told by a high school student so her voice is young and so is her world. This is the ONLY book in the series that's told by a teenager, however, we do see and hear Zillael in the rest of the series but circumstances are making her grow up fast, and right before our eyes.If this is the first book you've read in the Parched novel series and you wish to continue reading on, then Parched (book 1) will be the next read. You shouldn't move on to Quenched (Parched, book 3) without first reading book 1.", "price": 2.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CoFXYkfcL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Nonfiction"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Series"]]}

It would be great if we all knew exactly what we wanted and were strong enough to just do it. Even though it is a Holiday book, it is not overrun with Christmas or particulars, it is just that time of year, so this book could be read any time of year.

{"asin": "B00A5XJE7M", "description": "Night Owl ReviewsTansy's TitanCosmos' Gateway Book 3&#xa0;Score: 4.50 / 5 - Reviewer Top Pick&#xa0;Mak is the biggest of the brothers of the ruling family of Baade but he's also the most vulnerable.  His size has intimated those around him all his life and as his brothers find their bond mates he longs for the same.  But what woman, let alone a frail human one, will not cringe from him?  Tansy Bell is the one he feels is meant to be his, and when she's in danger he goes after her prepared for her disgust.  What he gets is a dream come true.  Tansy protects herself after a love affair that ended in death for her lover.  In the world of espionage she's immersed herself. She knows her life span is going to be short and when she achieves her goal she'll have nowhere to run on this planet.  But what about another one?I loved this third book in the series the most.  Mak and Tansy are the most damaged of the couples, in my opinion, and benefit the most from having a mate.  It brings them both back from the edge of despair and gives them something to live for - each other.  With more teasing glimpses of future stories and delightful updates on Tink and Hannah and their growing families, this is a series I will follow as long as the author keeps writing.", "price": 2.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RNKaa2n3L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction"], ["Books", "Romance", "Fantasy"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Fantasy"]]}

{"asin": "B00ASP8XNS", "description": "As a big fan of Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You, Crossfire series, I thought perhaps I had something in me that was worth writing. E.L. James and Sylvia Day have done so much for the erotic romance genre and I do want to tip my hat to those authors. Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You have blazed a trail. Thank you, E.L. James and Sylvia Day from this author and all those who follow in your amazing footsteps.***About Knowing his Secret (Year of the Billionaire Vol. #1)I've always loved acting. I drew on my experiences in amateur theater for the setting where Tristan and Raina meet. A lot of people are surprised at how much talent can be found in Little Theaters. Even though folks don't get paid, they put a lot of effort and time into these productions. I thought that the setting would be a good way to keep the characters together without having them actuallyworktogether. For me, the apprentice and the big powerful boss is a plot line that's getting a bit worn.In creating the characters for Knowing his Secret, I wanted to craft believable people. I didn't want to take a cookie cutter image of a dominant billionaire and an innocent young woman. Tristan has his warts (of course, not the physical kind) and Raina is no pushover. As the series progresses, there is a subtle shift in the power dynamic. Even though the characters are larger than life, I wanted to reflect the kind of changes that naturally take place in a relationship over time.Attention to detail is one of my obsessions. I probably don't need to do as much research as I do for my books, but I want to make sure that you can get from point A to point B in fifteen minutes if I say you can. Particularly in part two of this series--Taking his Risk, I add quite a bit of background to the characters' little French vacation.", "price": 14.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dkQcqmOxL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction"], ["Books", "Romance", "Contemporary"], ["Books", "Romance", "New Adult & College"], ["Books", "Romance", "Romantic Suspense"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Contemporary"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Mystery & Suspense", "Suspense"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "New Adult & College"]]}

{"asin": "B00B95V7JS", "description": "Dear Reader:I was kind of surprised when UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL ended up being what's called a &#x22;sweet romance&#x22; and is definitely &#x22;G-rated.&#x22;&#xa0; As I was writing the story I kept waiting for Jason and Angie to, well, succumb to temptation, but it never happened. For me, themnothaving sex felt right for the way these characters developed. Angie is kind of innocent, and her naivete about life and thinking she's &#x22;in control&#x22; actually allowed her to at least control one thing: no sex before marriage. It's what fit her character.I fell totally in love with Jason as soon as he appeared on the page...he's definitely a &#x22;wounded hero&#x22;--one who believes he won't ever fall in love again. And that's okay with him.&#xa0; He's worked hard to make his life rewarding--he's already taken the time to reexamine his priorities and is pretty content. He truly feels he doesn't need a woman in his world. Until he meets Angie.So, this is a story about fated people--Angie and Jason are meant to be together, and that's what's so fun to write--expecially when they don't agree!The subplots in the story really are special to me as well.&#xa0; I do tend to write about dealing with relationships--and in this story, the focus is on parents.I also hope you will be touched by the theme: the past doesn't have to trap you...and how important it is to acknowledge and learn from the past rather than either keeping it hidden or ignoring it completely. I truly believe the past is meant to teach us, even though the lessons may be painful.I love to hear from readers, so feel free to send me a note.&#xa0; And if you'd like to be on my once-in-awhile contact list, please let me know.&#xa0; mail (at) janetwellington (dot) com or visit my author Facebook page&#xa0;facebook.com/JanetWellingtonBooksThat's all for now,Janet Wellington", "price": 2.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511o06jOxIL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Domestic Life"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Family Life"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Nonfiction"]]}

Love dropped out of college after having her son, and then relocated to Raleigh, North Carolina. While working at a call center, in-between calls and on her break, she would read urban fiction. Soon she began working on her own novel as her interest in writing returned. Thanks to a chance encounter, Love linked up with best-selling author Treasure E. Blue on a social networking site. He introduced her to other literary heavyweights that shared resources to help her perfect her craft and offered invaluable advice. After receiving encouragement and mentoring from Nakea Murray of The Literary Consultant Group and David Weaver of SBR Publications, she decided to bring her dreams to fruition. Taking a leap of faith, Love quit her job and began writing full-time. Her novel 'Already Taken' hit virtual bookshelves in July and became an overnight bestseller. After much hard work, she is now the CEO and Founder of JME Publications, which specializes in romance books for the hood. Love currently lives in Atlanta with her four-year-old son. Outside of writing, she enjoys reality TV, K-dramas, and traveling.", "price": 3.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mn%2BP2PA3L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Drama"], ["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "United States", "African American", "Urban"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Arts & Photography", "Theater"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Drama & Plays"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Urban"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "United States", "African American", "Urban"]]}

The introduction made me cry; I knew that this was going to be a book that played with me.Nix~ Scorching Book ReviewsThe sex was beyond hot and explosive. You could totally tell that the\nsexual relationship between them was something much deeper than sex. It\nwas something real and something that was scary for both Wyatt and\nMichelle.

Ivy and Jake have strong personalities tempered by self-doubt, so it's fun to watch them wrestling for control. This is a series, so one hopes some unanswered questions will be resolved in the next installment.When Ivy blows a tire on a lonely desert road, heading from San Diego to Las Vegas, she's prepared to run to the nearest call box. She doesn't expect a gorgeous Marine named Jake to come to her rescue. Jake is on his way to Vegas after his commanding officer orders some much-needed R&R.; After he hooks her car up to his truck, they engage in some verbal sparring. They respond to their attraction by setting up a date but agree on a &#x22;hands off&#x22; policy. Ivy and Jake have been plagued by failed relationships -- her short marriage and his brief affairs -- and are looking for the commitment they've never found before.", "price": 2.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-oYhltYOL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Contemporary Women"], ["Books", "Romance", "Military"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Contemporary Fiction", "Women's Fiction"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Romance"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Military"]]}

He becomes her no-strings lover, longing for but terrified of a closer role. When word gets out that European interests may buy the mill, possibly damaging the environment but surely saving the town, the two clash on the issue. Butting heads by day and pressing bodies at night, they find their passion drawing them closer even as their suspicions tear them apart. A person who discovers that Cammie may actually own the mill goes missing, a major player turns up dead and escalating doubt threatens the couple's unexpressed love. But as Cammie observes, &#x22;The heart wasn't logical, of course, or particularly bright. . . . It had few principles, less sense.&#x22; Exhaustive sex scenes distract from the solid plotting and truly felt male/female dynamics, but fans of the multimillion-selling Blake ( Arrow to the Heart and some 40 other novels) will be thoroughly pleased.

{"asin": "B00CQAE2BU", "description": "@Melissa Schroeder, reprinted with permission&quot;Whatcha doing there?&quot; he asked.She looked down at the knife and pineapple. &quot;Playing bridge.&quot;He chuckled, although it didn't sound happy. &quot;Did I ever tell you you're a little sarcastic for your own good?&quot;&quot;Many times, but I have also told you that I only do it with you and other people I love. Let me finish this up and then we can decide what to do tonight.&quot;&quot;I didn't say I was spending tonight with you.&quot;&quot;It's five on a Friday, you're in a rotten mood and I'm not letting you hit any damned clubs in Honolulu tonight. You'll do something you'll regret. Then, I will have to deal with that. I don't have time for that. How about we do dinner in?&quot;He smiled. &quot;That sounds good.&quot;&quot;And you can drink as much as you want and stay over.&quot;She packaged up the fruit while Colin made himself coffee.&quot;I might want some of that,&quot; he said without turning around.&quot;Too bad. It's for the Santinis.&quot;&quot;Santinis? There are more of them?&quot;Before she could answer, she heard her SUV pull into the drive and then over to the cottage she rented Marco.&quot;Yes. They're here to visit.&quot;She picked up the container and headed to the door. She felt him on her heels and turned around and put her hand on his chest. If Colin saw her with the lieutenant, he would know she was interested in him.&quot;No. You stay here. I'm not going to deal with you and them.&quot;He frowned but there was a bit of sparkle in his eyes. She sighed and headed out to catch the brothers before they left. She could have slipped in earlier and left the fruit for them but she didn't. She knew the lieutenant wouldn't have minded but for some reason, that had felt wrong. Unless there was a good reason, she didn't like to invade a tenant's privacy.As she neared the cottage, the noise level rose. There was laughing and she was sure insults. She smiled. It reminded her a lot of her brothers when they were younger. Kai and Mikala always seemed to have their volume set to twenty on a scale of ten. She knocked on the door, then had to do it again because apparently she couldn't be heard over the discussion.The door opened with a whoosh and she came face to face with a younger version of Santini. Except, this one was blond and had golden brown eyes. He blinked, then, his lips curved. Two dimples appeared.Oh, my.&quot;Well, hello. Can I help you?&quot; he asked.&quot;Who is it, Gee?&quot; a man asked loudly from somewhere in the cottage. She wasn't sure if it was Lieutenant Santini though.&quot;I have no idea but I think I'm in love,&quot; the aforementioned Gee said.&quot;Lieutenant Santini, it's just me.&quot;She thought she heard him curse, then he came to the door with a frown. Oh, no, he was irritated with her. She always tried her best to stay out of her tenants' way but she wanted to make sure his brothers were welcomed properly to the island.&quot;I just brought some pineapple by for your brothers.&quot;&quot;You can move now, Gee,&quot; the lieutenant said.&quot;I think Mom would be embarrassed by your manners.&quot; He didn't stop staring at her and something tickled the back of her throat as she felt her face heat up. He took her hand in his. &quot;My name is Gianni, but everyone calls me Gee. Will you marry me?&quot;Before she could answer, another of the brothers showed up. This one was older and if possible, bigger. Dark haired and blue-eyed, he was just a gorgeous as the others. Goodness.&quot;And you can call me, Vince.&quot;&quot;Go away. I found her first,&quot; Gee said playfully. &quot;If you won't marry me, how about just dating me?&quot;Vince bumped his brother in the back but Gee ignored him. The older brother sighed. &quot;How many times do I have to tell the rest of you? Finders are not keepers, especially when there's a Marine around.&quot;&quot;She's mine,&quot; Marco said.Both brothers broke their attention from her and looked at him. She did the same and thought his cheeks were turning pink. It was actually very cute. He was such a big man and to see him blush...well it made her like him even more.&quot;Sorry, I didn't mean it that way. I meant this is my landlady, Alana Kailikea. These are two of my idiot brothers. The third is on the phone with his wife.&quot;She couldn't say anything. There was just too much male beauty to form a coherent thought. Two of them were smiling at her and one was frowning, but it didn't matter. Any heterosexual woman would have problems speaking around them. Lord, Honolulu wouldn't know what hit them.&quot;Guys, you're making her nervous. And, Gee, it's going to be hard to be a PJ missing a hand.&quot;&#xa0;Gee raised her hand to his lips, kissed it, then winked before letting it go. After the brothers shuffled back in the house, Santini sighed.&quot;I'm sorry about that. They can be pains in the a...butt.&quot;She smiled. &quot;No worries. My brothers were the same way. Here's the pineapple. I don't want to intrude on your weekend, but seeing that you're men, I have a feeling you won't make it to a good produce stand before they leave. Everyone needs to have fresh pineapple when they come to the islands. It's a rule.&quot;Good lord, she was rambling on about fruit and Hawaii. She blamed it on the Santinis but it was one reason she avoided long conversations with the lieutenant. She babbled when she was confronted by a gorgeous man.He took the fruit and smiled. &quot;That sounds fantastic. But we might have some decent food since Vince likes to cook.&quot;&quot;I'm not cooking for you, Marco,&quot; his brother yelled from the other room.&quot;I'll let you get back to your brothers. Make sure you let me know if you need anything.&quot;He nodded and just kept staring at her. He was so quiet at times, it was hard to be in his presence. For a few moments, she just stood there and stared. When she realized what she was doing, she stepped back.", "price": 2.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tB5tYd6UL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "War"], ["Books", "Romance", "Contemporary"], ["Books", "Romance", "Military"], ["Books", "Romance", "Multicultural"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle Short Reads", "Two hours or more (65-100 pages)", "Romance"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "War"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Contemporary"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Military"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Multicultural & Interracial"]]}

When she pulled back he was amazed she didn't pat him on the head. That was just not going to do.&#x22;That wasn't a kiss, Kianna.&#x22;God, he loved her name. It rolled off his tongue every time he said it. He could imagine what it sounded like when he groaned it.Whoa, boy, slow down. He had an o dark thirty appointment with a plane. He just thanked his mother for her early training. He was packed and ready to go, so it made it easy for him to spend the entire day with Kianna.&#x22;It wasn't?&#x22; She shook her head. &#x22;Then what was it?&#x22;&#x22;A peck.&#x22;She frowned. &#x22;Funny, I thought it was a kiss.&#x22;He shook his head. &#x22;No. This is a kiss.&#x22;He slipped his hand to the small of her back and stepped closer. Leaning down, he slammed his mouth over hers. She tasted sweet as he thought she would. Tempting, sugary...a decadent treat he wanted to gorge himself on. By the time he pulled himself back, they were both breathing heavily and he was busy convincing his body that there would be no reward tonight.&#x22;Thank you for the wonderful day, Kianna.&#x22;He gave her another brush of his mouth over hers. &#x22;I have your email. I hope you don't mind a few emails from me.&#x22;She smiled. &#x22;I wouldn't have given you my card if I did.&#x22;He opened her car door and waited for her to slide in before shutting it. &#x22;Drive safely.&#x22;She nodded. &#x22;Be safe, Gianni.&#x22;He watched her drive away, her taillights fading into the night before he walked to his truck.&#xa0; He was always safe, always looked forward to his homecoming.He licked his lips and he could still taste her there.

{"asin": "B00CZXWTHC", "description": "Reviewed by Natasha Jackson for Readers' FavoriteTrust Me tells the story of Alaina's desperate fight to prove her father was not a terrorist. Undercover FBI agent, Donovan Prentice, is posing as a lawyer to gain access to the documents. Donovan thinks there is evidence of terrorism hidden in those papers and it is up to him to convince Alaina to hand them over. Anna Wells makes it clear from their first early morning drugstore meeting that they'll be doing battle in and out of the courtroom. The sparks fly immediately and after their first meeting you just know that all that simmering sexual tension has to boil over...eventually.Anna Wells' story has all of the elements to make it great; fast paced witty banter, gunfire, sexual tension, and a mystery. Even though Donovan thinks Alaina may also be a suspect, he is unable to fight his attraction to her, nor hers to him, and the inner struggle adds needed depth to the story. Although I really liked Donovan, at times he came across as sleazy so I struggled with loving him and loathing him. And the sex? Well, that was as hot as I knew it would be and I love that Alaina tried to convince herself it was just sex when she found out he was lying. I mean, I understand lying to yourself, and it being his job is no excuse, but even Elise didn't believe her and I found the interaction particularly hilarious. Trust Me is a funny erotic tale that touches on some important privacy and civil rights issues that are more than a little relevant in the United States today.Anna Wells has proven herself to be a solid story teller, capable of weaving love, sex, humor, and intrigue into one great tale.", "price": 9.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YUMUtMJSL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction"], ["Books", "Romance", "Contemporary"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Contemporary"]]}

Some of those gods took advantage, and to their surprise, they became human and fell prey to the sensual lure of humanity. Angels dispatched to regulate the situation also fell to the lure of human love.&#xa0;The Tryah-an angel, a Deuce and a Dragon-tried to stop the proliferation of half-human/half-god offspring, known as Crescents, by inciting war. The violence caused the energy to shift back so suddenly that the island sank.

Because of their god essence, they can see demons and creatures Mundanes humans cannot. Crescents straddle the razor's edge of the Hidden and the normal world, fighting dark elements as well as the dissension between the three classes of god progeny. It doesn't help that they are all confined to the Miami area, because they require the energy in the Triangle to feed their god essence. Technology has made it much harder to hide their true natures.

{"asin": "B00DCQKH66", "description": "I was born in Sweden and live in Ireland (married to an Irishman). I started my writing career by writing non-fiction and wrote two books about health and fitness (I am a trained fitness teacher). While writing these books, I discovered how much I loved the actual writing process. My then editor gave me the idea to write a fun novel based on my experiences as a diplomat&#x2019;s wife. This became my debut novel, &#x2018;Diplomatic Incidents&#x2019; (the e-book version is called &#x2018;Duty Free&#x2019;), published in 2001. I wrote three further novels, &#x2018;European Affairs&#x2019; (now as an e-book with the title &#x2018;Villa Caramel&#x2019;), &#x2018;Fresh Powder&#x2019; (2006) and &#x2018;Finding Margo&#x2019;(2007). The latter two were published by New Island Books in Dublin. In 2010, when the publishing industry started to decline, I broke away from both publisher and agent and e-published my backlist, along with two novels that were with my agent for submission. Since then I have written and e-published four further novels and, as a result, now have ten books out there in the e-book market worldwide. I write mainly in the women&#x2019;s fiction genre, some chick-lit, some contemporary romance, with two historical novels and two detective stories thrown into the mix. I enjoyed writing those but my first love is romantic fiction with a lot of humour and heart.  My bestselling romantic comedy, Fresh Powder was translated to German last year and, with the title &#x2018;Frischer Schnee&#x2019;, is selling well on Amazon.de.

I am not one for reading &#x22;his&#x22; POV books but after reading several books by this author, I really love her stories and her writing style and wanted to give it a chance and know more about their story. I am so not surprised, not only was I pleased with this companion novel, I was seriously impressed with the story and it was beyond any expectation I had for it. This book truly was a brand new totally different book with only a few familiar parts and scenes from the The Lonely. And you may ask how could that be, and my only response is Only Tara Brown could pull that off!~~~~~~~READING THE LONELY FIRST IS A MUST BEFORE YOU READ LOST BOY~~~~~~~This book for me was all the amazing, interesting, heartwarming and mind blowing parts that were missing from The Lonely, although until I read Lost Boy, I truly did not realize that they were every missing. Getting his POV truly completes this story and see all of the characters in a completely different light, I loved them all in The Lonely but truly fell in love with each one of them in this book.This book is truly hard to describe without giving the whole thing away, and to categorize it, there truly is only one genre and it's the genre Tara Brown . This book is a romance with a dark story line to it that will make you laugh and feel so good inside, then have you gutted and ugly crying and then moments later having your mind completely blown when you least expect it.

Bella Andre just never disappoints.&#x22;~The Revolving Bookcase Reviews&#x22;Addictions come in all shapes and sizes, but nothing feels as indulgent and irresistible to me as a new Bella Andre book.Bella Andre finds the perfect balance between romance and steam, giving us another addictive Sullivans fairy tale, another couple to adore and another delicious happily ever after to re-awaken the dreamers in all of us.&#x22; ~Natasha Is A Book Junkie Reviews&#x22;Bella Andre is one of my top autobuy authors.&#xa0;She never fails to bring heat and heart in her stories. They are always such a great escape, making you fall in love many times over again. However, there is one thing I love best about her stories. It's the way she makes family important in every one of her books. You don't just feel the romantic love, but also the loyalty and undying love the characters have for their siblings as well.&#xa0;If you have a soft spot for big families, then the Sullivans must be a series you check out. Just be prepared to want to marry into the family, because their love feels majestic and untouchable.&#x22;&#xa0;~Annie from Under The Covers Book Reviews&#x22;Rafe has taken my breath away...I absolutely adore Bella Andre and the way that she combines eroticism with love; laughter with love....Yes, it all stems around love - the love of a good man, the love of a wonderful family and the love of your life. You laugh, you cry and you smile all at the same time. But, most of all, you wait breathlessly for the next Sullivan story.&#x22; ~Kitty from Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews", "price": 17.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511Aq9Y18dL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Contemporary Women"], ["Books", "Romance", "Contemporary"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Contemporary Fiction", "Women's Fiction"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Romance"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Sagas"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Collections & Anthologies"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Contemporary"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Series"]]}

{"asin": "B00DQ4WFKA", "description": "Jez Strider (1983-Present) is a native of Tennessee. For as long as she can remember, reading has been a big part of her life, taking her out of a sometimes harsh reality to wonderful new worlds. When she was in high school, writing became more prevalent. She worked for three years on the newspaper staff as the Arts and Entertainment editor. After graduation and a few bumps in the road, she enrolled at Penn Foster College with a focus in freelance writing. It took several years before she realized she wanted to give writing a book a shot. In 2011, she was diagnosed with cancer. That fight and becoming a survivor gave her new insight and motivations toward her goals. With the realization that none of us are guaranteed tomorrow, she started work on that elusive book. Vampire's Eve is her first publication. Today, Jez still resides in Tennessee with her boyfriend, cat, and dog. She is currently working on her next book. Feel free to like Jez on Facebook.

{"asin": "B00E5FXZ0S", "description": "If you have not read the three previous books you need to stop right now. This is a well-written intricate series of books that pick up where the previous book left off, so it is definitely not a standalone.Cosmos made an appearance in the first and subsequent books and is the reason for all the ruckus. The portal he created brought humans and Prime into contact and the rest is history. Prime have a population problem that human women can help fix, and we are more than compatible. Cosmos found out in the last book that he and Terra, daughter of the high chancellor of the Prime, are bonded mates. Problem is Daddy doesn't want his daughter mated to a scrawny human. Bigger problem is Cosmos isn't going to take no for an answer, and he'll show it takes more than brawn to protect a woman.This was another story that I devoured in this series, and look forward to many more. Both Cosmos and Terra were well-defined as people, but Cosmos a little more so since the reader has had much more interaction with him throughout the books. There is a sense of humor prevalent throughout the books and this one in particular when it comes to punishing the high chancellor for his egotistical behavior concerning his daughter. As usual, there is lots of build up to the big sexual bonding as well as updates on the previous romances and how they are coming along. A long-running story line came to a conclusion in this book and I have to wonder where the author is going to go next. - Night Owl Reviews", "price": 2.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AEa77YLAL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction"], ["Books", "Romance", "Science Fiction"], ["Books", "Science Fiction & Fantasy"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Science Fiction"]]}

I could be easily pleased by one man now, and I largely allowed him to direct our sex, because that was what he liked. He had certain restrictions when it came to his body that stemmed from his childhood abusers. He couldn't stand it when I approached him from behind. He'd been struck from this direction during his punishments; the coward hadn't wanted Cameron to look him in the face.&#xa0; He hadn't yet overcome his sense of the unknown, and felt that what was happening was beyond his control. So I made sure he heard me when I entered a room. And I was extremely careful about where I placed my hands and lips; I didn't want those to trigger anything, either. I was still learning his other quirks, and I was allowing him to lead. While Cee may have permitted herself to be dominated, letting someone else take the reins during sex was new for Charlie. And instead of creating art as my heart and emotions called me to, I was creating pieces of art for specific clients, tailored to their tastes and not mine.&#xa0; I was taking orders directly from them. Teachers dictated my assignments, creditors dipped into my finances. Lilly's evil voice appeared in my head whenever it wanted to.It didn't feel like I dominated anything in my life anymore.But the desire for that was still present. It pulsed, throbbed, thrashed because it wasn't getting attention.I was burying it in the world that Cameron was creating for me.But Chet had reminded me of what I missed. He'd shown me a glimpse of what a part of me wanted back, what it felt I truly was and what it yearned to be again. I had done everything I could to curb Cee, to distance myself from the mansion, and to draw myself closer to Cameron.What if I couldn't any longer?What if I needed a place where she could come alive?What if Cee was really the soul of me, and Charlie was just another mask I wore?", "price": 0.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LLxcWjtUL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Erotica"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Erotica", "Romantic Erotica"]]}

Growing up in Wyandotte County, the roughest and poorest county in Kansas, Boo endued her fair share of hardships but still managed to graduate from Wyandotte High School with honors in 2002. She went on to college to study Psychology and Social Work, but then was grabbed by a burning desire to share the many stories inside of her. Her first novel was penned at the tender age 20, while working as a security guard. The book was written because of a bet she had with her baby sister. Laid back and easy going, Boo still possesses an eagerness to please and a determination to succeed. Boo is able to grab her readers with engaging, unique story lines. She touches on all subjects from romance, street life, lust and even racism. Her style is fast paced while still being detail orientated, witty and extremely humorous. Boo's literary diversity led to her acquiring a publishing deal with #TBRS Pleasure Principle Publications where her novel 'Undercover' graced the National Best Sellers List.

Although she waited until she was in her 40's to publish for the first time, writing has been a lifelong passion. Her motivation to take that step was her students: teaching creative writing to elementary age students all the way up through high school and encouraging those students to follow their writing dreams gave Samantha the confidence to take that step as well. Her second book, a holiday novella titled &#x22;The Christmas Cottage&#x22; hit #10 on Amazon's Overall Best Seller List on Christmas Eve. It was a great Christmas gift!

In March 2013, &#x22;The Christmas Cottage&#x22; was nominated for two Indie Romance Convention Award - Best Indie Romance Novella and Best Indie Contemporary Romance while Samantha was nominated for Indie Author of the Year! In August 2013, the video trailer for &#x22;Wait for Me&#x22; won an Oscar for Indie Author Book Trailer!

One day it occurred to me to write an adventure that flowed like a video game and I added a touch of romance. Thus, Hypnotic Journey was born. The HJ characters are like a family to me. They are foolish, daring, resourceful and full of passion not only for life but for the friendships they have created in this world and the next. My love for Science Fiction gave birth to the Treborel Series. Paranormal romance adventures featuring a psychotic villain and a multiple layer of hero's fighting to survive the chaos. I write about how friendship and love can carry you through situations that you might not otherwise survive. You will find my stories exciting and steamy but I am not an erotic writer.

She currently resides in Southern Louisiana with her husband and two children but her heart is always Carolina day dreaming.  Chelsea always wanted to be a writer, but like most of us, let fear of the unknown grab a hold of her dream; she realized that if she was going to tell her daughter to go for her dreams, that it was time to follow her own advice. Chelsea grew up turning wrenches alongside her father, and from that grew her love for old muscle cars and Harley Davidson motorcycles, which just so happened to inspired her &#x2018;Daddy&#x2019;s Girls&#x2019; series. Her love for reading has sparked a new love for writing and she currently has a few more projects in the works.  When she is not spending her days writing you can find her playing with her kids, attending car shows, going on motorcycle rides on the back of her husband&#x2019;s Harley, snuggling down with her new favorite book or watching any movie that Vin Diesel might happen to be in.  She hates being serious and is still a big kid at heart. She is a small town country girl enjoying life and, Chelsea hopes that her readers remember not to take life too seriously and to embrace your inner five year old, because five year olds know how to enjoy the simple things in life and how to always have fun.", "price": 0.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51z2OBYmJNL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Short Stories", "Single Author"], ["Books", "Romance", "Contemporary"], ["Books", "Romance", "New Adult & College"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Contemporary Fiction", "Short Stories"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Short Stories", "Single Authors"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Contemporary"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "New Adult & College"]]}

My heroine Rachel\nMurphy agrees which is why she wants to stay far, far away from him. Now\n if it was me, I'd be wanting to cook up something a little spicier than\n gingerbread in Nate's gourmet kitchen! Though I do have a sweet tooth. But I understand, Rachel was burned by a celebrity chef. She's wary, cautious.

Without judgment, he weaves humanizing back stories that serve up\ncompelling reasons for why a drug dealer might choose a life of crime.&#xa0;Readers of his work, speak\nof the roller coaster ride of emotions that ensues from feeling anger at\nempathetic characters who always seem to do the wrong thing at the right time, to\nkeep the story moving forward.&#xa0;In terms of setting, Blake's\nstories introduce his readers to spaces they may or may not be used to -\nstreetscapes with unkept, cracked sidewalks where poverty prevails, times are\ndepressed and people are broke and desperate. In Blake storytelling space,\nmorality is so curved that rooting for bad guys to get away with murder can\nsometimes seem like the right thing for the reader to do - even when it's not.&#xa0;Readers who connect with\nBlake find him to be relatable. Likening him to a bad-boy gone good, they see a\nstoryteller who writes as if he's lived in the world's he generously shares,\nreadily conveying his message that humanity is everywhere, especially in the\nunlikely, mean streets of cities like Charlotte.", "price": 0.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UZOY1trTL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Urban Life"], ["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "United States", "African American", "Women's Fiction"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Contemporary Fiction", "Urban"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Urban"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "United States", "African American", "Women's Fiction"]]}

The number of cats in our house changes because I foster for\n a local humane society, usually seniors and ones with health issues. My\n own kitties range in age from 2 to 16 1/2 years old.&#xa0; I also have two\ndogs, who the cats tolerate. Well, sort of. The dogs know to keep their\ndistance, especially from the older cats!When\n I was asked to write a short Christmas romance story, I'd been dealing\nwith a couple sick cats that not only meant visits to the vet, but trips to an emergency animal hospital.&#xa0; The setting seemed a\nnatural fit for a short story. I also wanted to rewrite something\n that happened to me while I was writing Home For&#xa0; Christmas.I\nfound a stray cat in my backyard. Guess my crazy cat lady reputation\nmade the rounds with the local feline crew. Because I foster, I\nknew who to call and they got right to work. A couple hours later, I was\n with the cat, named Shasta by the humane society, at a vet office where\n he received much needed medical attention. I'd received a new foster\ncat the night before so he was taken in by the humane society and placed\n with a different foster. Unfortunately, Shasta didn't survive, but for\nthe last weeks of his life he was comfortable, warm, had plenty to eat\nand was loved. For me, that's what animal rescue and fostering senior\ncats is all about.But I'm a romance writer and prefer happy\nendings. Christmas is a time for magic and miracles so in Mistletoe\n Magic I wrote the ending I wanted for Shasta and every foster/stray cat\n out there.Montana, especially the quaint town of Marietta, is a\n wonderful place to spend the holidays.

The dialogue was great in the book, kept me really entertained between the girls before she left for a trip. Very entertaining characters, very real life like people. Lexi has a lot to contend with from her past, awful things. And every now and again throughout the book we took a glance of some of her sufferings when being brought up and about her mother and brother. It was glimpses that made me continue to read, always wondering when the full story would be revealed.&#xa0;If I had any downfall in this book, it was to say that Lucca is just a little too perfect.The book leaves you with a cliff hanger.

She fell in love with books as soon as she learned how to read. &#x201C;My mom read to us before bed, and I think that&#x2019;s how I started to love stories. It was like a little mini-vacation we looked forward to every night before going to sleep. I think I eventually read most of the books in my elementary school library.&#x201D; That love for books translated into a natural love for writing and a desire to create stories that other readers could get lost in, just as she had gotten lost in her favorite books. Her stories focus on the dynamics of relationships, those between a man and a woman, mother and daughter, sisters, friends. They most often take place in small Virginia towns very much like the one where she grew up and are peopled with characters who reflect those values and traditions. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s something about small-town life that&#x2019;s just part of who I am. I&#x2019;ve had the desire to live in other places, wondered what it would be like to be a true Manhattanite, but the thing I know I would miss is the familiarity of faces everywhere I go. There&#x2019;s a lot to be said for going in the grocery store and seeing ten people you know!&#x201D; Inglath Cooper is an avid supporter of companion animal rescue and is a volunteer and donor for the Franklin County Humane Society. She and her family have fostered many dogs and cats who have gone on to be adopted by other families. &#x201C;The rewards are endless. It&#x2019;s an eye-opening moment to realize that what one person throws away can fill another person&#x2019;s life with love and joy.&#x201D; See a list of Inglath's books at: www.inglathcooper.com/books Follow Inglath on Facebook at www.facebook.com/inglathcooperbooks Join her mailing list for news of new releases and giveaways at www.inglathcooper.com", "price": 2.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518k9rq8ZlL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction"], ["Books", "Romance", "Contemporary"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "Relationships", "Love & Romance"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Contemporary"]]}

Ashley and I have been best of friends since we were 13. I recently graduated from South University with my Associate's Degree as a Paralegal. I enjoy listening to music, playing with my kids, and going to the beach, and anything that has to do with the outdoors pretty much. I&#x2019;ve always liked to write, but never really had an interest in reading until the summer of 2012. I am so excited to be taking my writing journey with Ashley. I have many authors that I consider my favorite so I&#x2019;ll just name a few: E.L. James, SC Stephens, Molly McAdams, Rebecca Donovan, K.A Linde, Marie Coulson, and S.H. Kolee.  Ashley: Ashley grew up in Texas but now has joined her husband to reside in Virginia. She is a military wife and mother to two adorable children.

{"asin": "B00HEX4NSQ", "description": "Sibylla Matilde grew up in the mountain valleys of Southwest Montana exploring the dusty Old West gold country on the back of a horse. She attended a two-room schoolhouse beginning in 1st grade and had the same teacher until she changed schools after 7th. Beginning at about age 12, Sibylla discovered historical romance, feeding off of work of Jude Deveraux and Lisa Kleypas. She loves a book that can make the reader run the gamut of emotions, from the sweet glow of new love to gut-wrenching heartache. She is a true romantic and always has stories floating around in her head, living in a fantasyland until she writes them down to free them. Music is her emotional trigger. Growing up with a Wagnarian-loving mother, Sibylla was raised to treasure music that digs deep into the psyche, drawing out elation, sorrow, grief, desire. The soundtrack to her life includes many genres spanning centuries. She looooooooves Thirty Seconds to Mars (rather obsessively, actually... but, really, how can you NOT be crazy about those guys!?) and pimps them out to all her friends through Spotify. She also delights in Met Opera HD broadcasts at her local movie theater and hopes (listening Met?) to someday see Diana Damrau reprise her role as Mozart&#x2019;s Queen of the Night in Die Zauberfl&#xF6;te. Sibylla lives with her husband and hero who saved her from her own calamitous, young-adult self. He makes her laugh daily, even when things are tough. He&#x2019;s proved to her that love really can heal a shattered soul. In 18 years, they have never had a fight, although they argue regularly with their two teenage kids who have, unfortunately, inherited their father&#x2019;s quick wit (unfortunate as it is a quick wit that Sibylla, herself, definitely does not possess&#xAC;&#xAC;&#x2014;there is a reason she is a writer and not a stand-up comedian).

Her love for reading has sparked a new love for writing and she currently has a few more projects in the works.        When she is not spending her days writing you can find her playing with her kids, attending car shows, going on motorcycle rides on the back of her husband&#x2019;s Harley, snuggling down with her new favorite book or watching any movie that Vin Diesel might happen to be in. She hates being serious and is still a big kid at heart.

She has been married to her best friend for ten years, and together they have two of the most beautiful children in the world. She and her husband are Junior High Sweethearts, a couple who are truly meant to be together. One day, their love story might make it into a book.  Isabel is the middle name of the author, and Lucero is her maiden name. Together they create her pen name. She was born in a small town in New Mexico, and was more than happy to move far, far away.  She is a collector of high heels and tattoos, and is highly obsessed with both. She owns a crazy, little Miniature Pinscher who thinks he&#x2019;s a Doberman. His name is Tyson.  Isabel has always been an avid reader, able to devour books in a day or two. With her now focusing on writing, the reading has slowed, but her love for reading is still there.  Something noteworthy is that Isabel loves to hear from her readers. Never hesitate to get in touch. She&#x2019;s always willing and ready to talk about anything. If you enjoy this book, she encourages you to not only let her know, but let the world know. Goodreads, Amazon, book blogs, groups, etc. She understands that word of mouth is the best form of promotion.

Although she doesn't loyally follow or have favorite teams/athletes, Kimi loves a good hockey game or motorcross/x-treme sports event. Volunteering is extremely important to her and she and her family work with several local non-profit organizations. A portion of her sales will always go to charity. She's planning on publishing the last two books in this series by the end of the year. Book 3, Grafted Vines, is Dani & Zachary's story and book 4, Tangled Paths, is Bri & Josh's journey. And because every character has a story to tell, there's a possibility of a novella about Stefen and Bri's mother's life. There's a reason she acts the way she does and she may bug Kimi enough to have it written out.", "price": 0.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61NHnbTkbJL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Contemporary Women"], ["Books", "Romance", "Contemporary"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Contemporary Fiction", "Women's Fiction"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Romance"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance", "Contemporary"]]}

She is a self-proclaimed dork that loves to make people laugh and can trip over nothing. Her inner rock star is always on stage performing to a sold out crowd but is quiet and shy on the outside. She lives with her husband and son in Arizona, which is a big difference from where she grew up north of Chicago Illinois. As an only child she learned to tell herself stories to make the long winters go by quicker while dreaming of summer vacations. Now as an adult she still makes up stories to pass the time, but now she writes them down to share with other people. When not writing you can find M. watching football (Go Bears!), NASCAR, or classic movies, watching her husband and father restore classic cars, and seeing who can be sillier, her or her son, and of course reading. Things you don&#x2019;t know about M. Stratton: 1. She loves the movie Twister&#x2026; she can say all the lines along with the actors. She will also use those lines in real life as often as possible.   2. Halloween is her favorite holiday. She starts planning months in advance. She has more Halloween decorations than Christmas.   3. She once made up a monologue about her love of chocolate chip cookie dough for her high school drama class.   4. There are times she thinks she is so funny she has tears running down her face while laughing at herself.   5. M. can play the clarinet but is in awe of anyone who can play the guitar, piano or drums, pretty much anything where your hands have to do two different things at the same time.   6. Cary Grant is her favorite actor. When she was in high school after Cary Grant died one of the cable stations ran a marathon, she watched his movies from 6 in the morning all day and night until 4 AM the next day.   7. Reading has always been an escape for her. She can devour a book in hours. When she moved in with her husband she literally donated over 1,000 books and saved over 1,000 for herself. She can reread books over and over again if she loves them. There are some that she has reread about once a year for the past 20 years.   8.

These are friends and people you know.\nYou can't put down this book without knowing these people intimately and\n well!&#x22;Donna Cheatle&#x22;Skye Turners writing style is unique. There are few authors who I feel\ncan write conversations well, she is one of them.

In fact, the first time she was published was when she was seven years old and won a contest to be published in an American Girl Doll novel. Since then Cassandra has written more novels than she can count and put just as many in the circular bin. Her personal goal with her writing is to show the reader the character's stories through their dialogue and actions instead of just telling the reader what is happening. In 2012 she became a published Young Adult author, releasing In Between Seasons (The Fall, #1) and the Amazon bestselling thriller, Walking in the Shadows. In 2013 she branched out by using her artistic illustrating talents to publish her first Children's novel, The Adventures of Skippy Von Flippy: Tales of Friendship (Skippy Tales, #1). Cassandra released her first New Adult novel, Love Exactly, which became an Amazon Bestseller overnight in June of 2013. She's currently working on her new New Adult Contemporary Romance, Beautifully Flawed. The first novel in the series, Flawed Perfection is scheduled to be published on March 7, 2014. Besides being a writer, Cassandra is a professional photographer known for her automotive, nature and architectural shots. She is the owner of Gio Design Studios Photography and Gio Design Studios Publication Marketing . She is currently studying to receive a degree in Marketing.

{"asin": "B00J0D69KI", "description": "For Your Sake is a fantastic MC romance, with an emphasis on both the MC and the romance. The Mountain Skulls are an outlaw MC, so the club action is gritty and exciting from their first introduction, and Elayne DiSano gives us a clear-eyed picture of the life these men and their women lead.Ben and Eva, the romantic leads and POVs, are richly developed characters with heartbreaking backstories. They meet on a dark night, their individual pain foremost in their minds, and as they begin to know each other, they begin to heal each other.Eva is a strong, lovely woman, a normal woman trying to live the best life she can on her own terms. Ben is a gorgeous mountain of a man, whose work for his club is dark but who manages to keep some light and love to share with the right woman. If ever he should meet her. Trust comes dear to Ben; he takes a huge risk to trust anyone, as he well knows. To let his guard down is itself an act of love for him.The world of Tippitt, like so many real small towns, is populated with interesting characters--some of them quirky, some of them hilarious, some of them mysterious, and some who are just regular people.There is heart-fluttering romance, smokin' hot sex, intrigue, danger and drama--and surprise--in a tight plot that snares Ben and Eva and threatens the tenuous peace they've found with each other. Just at the moment they need each other most, circumstances beyond them threaten to tear them apart.But true love is strong, and trust can move mountains.--Susan Fanetti, author of the Signal Bend Series", "price": 2.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ucuiMEjuL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "categories": [["Books", "Literature & Fiction"], ["Books", "Romance"], ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Romance"]]}

{"asin": "B00JH65TA4", "description": "Deciding to write books was something I had contemplated for awhile. A co-worker of mine had gotten me started me on the 50 Shades Trilogy. I had quickly became absorbed! Reading contemporary romance had become apart of me. Little did I know that my daughter was a product of the &#x22;50 Shades Baby Boom&#x22;! I remember going to my doctor's appointment to find out that we were off to labor and delivery- and I didn't download any new books to my kindle! Talk about bummed out! However, I made up for that when I was home for my maternity leave. I believe we read 40+ books while I was home. I am a full time new mom, and wife. Yes, I do work full time, I am currently doing multiple things, bouncing back after baby, weight watchers, exercising, training for a 5k, reading and writing. So far, I have really enjoyed writing as a hobby. My work book club, &#x22;HE&#x22; had consumed us (and by us, I mean 2). We were critics of the stories and characters. I then thought to myself, &#x22;hmm, I bet I could write stories just like this, and have them turn out like I'd want them to.&#x22; Well, joking turned into thinking. Thinking turned into brainstorming. Brainstorming lead to opening a word document and letting my mind explore. Growing up I had written short stories with friends, and as extra credit for school. This is probably where it all started... I had turned in one of my short stories without re-reading, or editing it completely. I had my paper returned to me saying the &#x22;content was inappropriate.&#x22; Apparently contemporary romance was frowned upon in English class! Oops!

You are always welcome to contact me at: abby@type-writer.net I'm thirty-two years old and live in a small town in beautiful Ontario with my two dogs. I was born and raised here. I went to school in Montreal and Ottawa. I studied French, Women's Studies and Literature but wasn't the most focused student. I took creative writing classes in school but it wasn't till I got back to my hometown and was working as a waitress that I really started writing. I'm an only child and both my parents passed away when I was quite young. I do feel a bit alone in the world. I like to write about strong, adventurous women. They are the kinds of women I like to imagine I am, or at least would be if I had the courage. The protagonist usually has a difficult past or family life and is up against the world in some way. My stories are fairly graphic and erotic, but I also include a good story, strong character development, and a genuinely full and engaging reading experience. The sexual themes I write about all come from my own, private fantasies. They are the kinds of things I imagine happening to me, even though I know they are unlikely in real life.

I love feeling part of him inside of me--but it only makes me want to feel him absolutely everywhere.All at once, I find myself spinning in the air as he flips me onto my stomach. I writhe against the bed as he slips off my panties, the final stitch of fabric that lingers between us. I arch my back, letting my firm ass rise to him. He runs his fingers down my spine, sending waves of goose bumps dancing across my bare skin. Those hands graze over the rise of my rear, teasing me. He's doing this on purpose.&quot;Touch me,&quot; I beg, looking at him over my shoulder, &quot;Please, touch me.&quot;His golden eyes blaze with wicked, dominating lust as he looks at me, on my hands and knees before him.

My cheek presses hard against the mattress as my mouth falls open in wonder. My entire body trembles as he bears down on my cl**. Finally, when I don't think I'll be able to take another moment, I come hard. He buries a hand in my hair as I cry out my pleasure.
