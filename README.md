# Amazon Kindle Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the first project of the course! In this project, you will work with Amazon Kindle data, which consists of user reviews on books they purchased, along with some metadata about the books. You will apply concepts from the course, including working with MongoDB (Module 1), general machine learning concepts (Module 2), and implementing a product recommendation system (Module 3).

## Project Format
This project is structured as a guided Jupyter notebook. It includes both coding tasks and questions that require written responses in English within Markdown cells. These questions are designed to assess understanding of theoretical concepts, critical thinking skills, and ability to provide clear explanations.
